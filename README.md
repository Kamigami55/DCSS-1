## What we want to solve

Since the debris on space increase year by year. Some satellites are therefore being damaged by these garbage. Resulting in a considerable amount of loss. But the technology nowadays can not solve such a problem. In this case, we think a space ship with sustainabillity might be a good direction to improve the problem as Boyan Slat did. 

## Basic Idea

we try to obtain the orbit debris data and converse them into the longitude and latitude data. 
And display these information on a web using javascript and webGL. 
Also, with these data, we designed a new type of space ship to collect these debris. 
The importance of our design is that we only need to supply the fuel once and for all. 
The space ship will move by itself automatically. 
We illustrate such a model using 3D modeling.

## characteristic
1. use the gravity of earth to implement semi-automatic self-generating electric power
2. provide a new solution to clean the space debris
3. reusable
4. less fuel
5. use solar sails as power source to fix the latitude
6. positioning with tle of space debris
