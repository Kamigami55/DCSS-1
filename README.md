## What we do

we try to obtain the orbit debris data and converse them into the longitude and latitude data. 
And display these information on a web using javascript and webGL. 
Also, with these data, we designed a new type of space ship to collect these debris. 
The importance of our design is that we only need to supply the fuel once and for all. 
The space ship will move by itself automatically. 
We illustrate such a model using 3D modeling.
